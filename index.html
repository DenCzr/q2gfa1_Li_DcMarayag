            <h1>Nature</h1>
            <p>
                The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura 
                meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, 
                celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work.
            </p>
            
            <p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest 
                blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it 
                as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from 
                people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.</p>
